<div class="custom-all"><p>Gravity Pong is a local multiplayer game for up to four players to play each other in an interesting twist on the classic gameplay of pong. Using gravity, you can tether the ball around your paddle to score goals against your opponent. However, the paddles (you and your opponent) are affected by gravity, so you'll need to hop around to block the ball!</p>
